## Welcome to Adaptateur's Data Story

This work explore the general graph properties of three websites, [Epinions](www.epinions.com), [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)

We propose to study the popularity of the users in social media and their like/dislike behavior. For this purpose, we set to main axes, first we focus on the received votes, then we look at the voters behavior.

The github repo of our project is available [here](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2020-project-milestone-p3-p3_adaptateur).
